# Advent of Code 2025 - Rust Solutions

This directory contains the Rust solutions for the Advent of Code 2025 challenges.

## Running the Solutions

You can run the solution for a specific day using the `cargo run` command with the `--bin` flag.

For example, to run the solution for Day 1, use the following command from within the `rust` directory:
```bash
cargo run --bin day1
```
Replace `day1` with the binary name for the day you want to run (e.g., `day2`, `day3`, etc.).

### Performance

For better performance, it is recommended to run the solutions in release mode. This will compile the code with optimizations.

```bash
cargo run --release --bin day1
```

Solutions have been implemented for the following days:
- Day 1
- Day 2
- Day 3
- Day 4
- Day 5
- Day 6
